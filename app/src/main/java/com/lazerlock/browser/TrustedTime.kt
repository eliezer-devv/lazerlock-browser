/**
 * The time, as GitHub says it is, so changing the phone's clock doesn't get around timers or "for a while".
 *
 * Every answer from GitHub carries the time (its Date header). The phone notes it together with the time since the
 * phone started (which the clock setting can't change): until the phone restarts, the time is exactly GitHub's plus
 * the time since. It also keeps how far the phone's clock was from GitHub's ([offset]) and the latest time it was
 * sure of ([lastTrusted]), so after a restart it carries on from there, and never goes back past [lastTrusted].
 *
 * Until it hears from GitHub again after a restart (or after the clock was changed while the app was stopped), it's
 * [sure] = false: timers then use whichever reading is stricter (see [stricterNow]).
